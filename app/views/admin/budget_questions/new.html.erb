  Optional: If you want to render error messages for a default/blank object,
  though typically errors are shown after a failed submission which re-renders 'new'.
  If @budget_question is just Budget::Question.new, it won't have errors yet.

<div class="budget-question-form"> <%# Or your preferred generic form wrapper class %>

    Render the form partial.
    It will receive @budget_question (a new instance) and @budget (the parent).
    The _form.html.erb partial will then determine the correct form URL (for create)
    and render your Admin::Budget::Questions::FormComponent.
