###########
# Restores the content data from a Consul backup archive created with the
# backup-content.sh utility, in a production environment.
# Make sure that the vars are the same as in the backup utility (especially the
# custom ones).
# Must be run from the backups/ folder on the local (development) host, after
# having run the installer in a fresh environment.
# Usage:
# $> ../restore-content.sh BACKUP_FILE
# where BACKUP_FILE should be named something like 
# consul-data.backup.XXXX.tar.gz and live in ./, with XXXX a timestamp.
#
# * IMPORTANT
# -[ ] READ BUG #1, below
# -[ ] As usual, THIS SCRIPT COMES WITH NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND...
#
# * PREREQUISITES
# -[ ] Make sure to re-install the same version of the app as the one backed-up.
# Check the version.readme file in the backup tarball. 
# NOTE that although the
# installer and the main app are maintained with the same version number, it is
# likely that the installer has only been used once, and has not been kept 
# updated since. The version that matters is the main app's one.
# -[ ] Setup the new server, and update the config files on the local dev host
# accordingly. You may find helpful to rely on my own checklist to figure out
# your own: see CHECKLIST.setup. 
#
# * BUGS
# #1-[ ] after a single run, the site was displaying a 500 ERROR message.
# Re-running the script turned out fine. Go figure...
# -[ ] (no consequence): during backup, the attached files aren't copied with their relative
# path, as listed in the config var. Therefore, "config/" must be added
# at the end of the destination path. Both backup-content.sh and this script
# should be fixed simultaneously.
# -[ ] (no consequence): the 'linked_dirs' were backed up with the missing root folder 
# public/
#
# * TODO
# -[ ] recover the vars from backup-content.sh or somehow automate their
# consistency
# -[ ] take the list of paths where to restore the files directrly in the
# config file
# -[ ] make the psql/pg_restore command output in a log file. For some reason
# I can not make it work with psql, neither with the --output or --log-file, nor
# with a redirection command >>
