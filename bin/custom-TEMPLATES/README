To be able to use the scripts in this directory, first copy and paste them in
bin/custom. You may have to create the custom/ directory.
You can, then, proceed with the customisation of the scripts you are interested
in.
The backup-content.sh and restore-content.sh ones will not work without the
required custom values, such as the target domain name.
How to customize and use these two scripts is detailed in each file.

Please note that these scripts are provided with absolutely no guarantee or
warranty at all. Use them at your own risk.
